I am a technology leader, data scientist and chemist currently leading Data Science Strategist & Architect at Carrier.  I have over 15 years as a global technology leader, with experience in data science, and over 20 years of experience in industrial coatings.  I enjoy working at the intersection of product development and innovation, and have successfully developed and launched solutions spanning coil coatings, inventory management and hospital patient safety.
