Summary: How will generative AI impact the field of chemistry as the technology matures?

As generative AI models continue to become more sophisticated, we're now seeing their application to the physical sciences.  In March 2024, Anthropic reported that Claude 3 Opus achieved 50.4% on the [Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A (GPQA) Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12022).  GPQA consists of 448 multiple-choice questions written by domain experts in biology, physics, and chemistry.  To give context, human experts that have, or were pursuing, their PhD in the above fields achieved 65%, while non-experts achieved 34%, even if given free reign to search the web for answers.  OpenAI recently reported that [ChatGPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/) achieved 53.6%.  Models are now approaching graduate-level performance in these domains.  We're also seeing AI more generallly applied to scientific discovery, as demonstrated by announcements about this [AI-enabled discovery of new materials for batteries](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/scientists-built-a-low-lithium-battery-from-a-new-material-that-took-just-hours-to-discover-thanks-to-ai), and this paper about the use of [generative AI coupled with transformer-based encoder-decoders to accelerate drug discovery](https://news.chapman.edu/2024/06/18/chapman-researchers-use-ai-to-create-medications/).
