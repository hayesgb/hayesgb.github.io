I am a global technology leader, data scientist and chemist, currently working in Data Science Strategy & Architecture at Carrier.  This is my personal microsite, where I write about topics unrelated to my current employment.

My experience includes 15 years in Data Science, MLOps and Enterprise/System Architecture, and 20 years in Coil Coatings.  I'm a fan of open source software, an advocate of Design Thinking and a student of AI.
